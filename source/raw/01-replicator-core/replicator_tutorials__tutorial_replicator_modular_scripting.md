# Modular Behavior Scripting

## Overview

This tutorial introduces the `isaacsim.replicator.behavior` extension and walks through its modular behavior scripts for Isaac Sim Replicator synthetic data generation (SDG). Built on top of the [Python Scripting Component](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_python-scripting-component/user_manual.html), these behaviors attach directly to prims in a USD stage and act as randomizers or custom smart-asset behaviors that are reusable, shareable, and easy to modify.

The behavior functionality ships as two extensions:

* `isaacsim.replicator.behavior` — the core extension containing the behavior scripts. It has no UI dependency and runs in headless mode.
* `isaacsim.replicator.behavior.ui` — the UI extension that renders exposed variables in the **Property** panel.

The two extensions communicate through a carb event, so the core can run without the UI loaded. See [Core and UI extension split](#core-and-ui-extension-split) for details.

Find the bundled behavior scripts under:

`/exts/isaacsim.replicator.behavior/isaacsim/replicator/behavior/behaviors/*`

### Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will understand how to:

* **Use pre-built behavior scripts** for common synthetic data generation tasks, including:

  + **Location Randomizer** - randomizes prim positions within specified bounds for object placement variety
  + **Rotation Randomizer** - applies random rotations to enhance orientation diversity in datasets
  + **Look At Behavior** - makes prims continuously face target locations or other prims for camera tracking
  + **Light Randomizer** - randomizes light properties like color and intensity to simulate different lighting conditions
  + **Texture Randomizer** - applies random textures to materials for increased visual variety
  + **Volume Stack Randomizer** - uses physics simulation to randomly stack objects for realistic arrangements
* **Understand behavior script architecture** - how modular Python scripts attach to prims and can be customized through exposed USD attributes, with configurable parameters like update intervals and randomization ranges
* **Control behavior execution** - configure behaviors to run on timeline events (start, update, stop) or trigger them independently using custom events for advanced workflows
* **Create custom behavior scripts** - develop your own behaviors using the provided templates and base classes for specific synthetic data generation needs
* **Build complex SDG pipelines** - combine multiple behaviors, simulations, and events to create sophisticated data generation workflows, such as physics-based object stacking followed by automated data capture

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you are familiar with:

* USD and Isaac Sim APIs for creating and manipulating USD stages
* [Python Scripting Component](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_python-scripting-component/user_manual.html) in Isaac Sim
* The [timeline](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_animation-timeline.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") and [custom events](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/latest/guide/events.html) system
* [omni.replicator](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") and its Isaac Sim [tutorials](tutorial_replicator_getting_started.html#isaac-sim-app-tutorial-replicator-getting-started) for synthetic data generation
* [Writers](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/writer_examples.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") and [annotators](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/annotators_details.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") for data capture
* Running scripts using the [Script Editor](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_script-editor.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") to setup and run pipelines

Note

To attach behavior scripts to prims from the UI (**Property** panel > **Add** > **Python Scripting**), enable the `omni.behavior.scripting.ui` extension from **Window** > **Extensions**. This extension ships the Python Scripting Component UI and is not enabled by default. The core behaviors in `isaacsim.replicator.behavior` run without it, which is useful for headless SDG pipelines.

### Demonstration

The [example section](#isaac-sim-app-tutorial-replicator-modular-scripting-example) provides a demonstration of how to use the behavior scripts to create a custom synthetic data generation pipeline:

### Behavior scripts

**Behavior scripts** are modular Python scripts attached to prims in a USD stage. By default, they respond to timeline events — start, pause, stop, and update — and define the randomization or custom logic applied to the prim during simulation or data generation.

Attaching scripts directly to prims embeds the behavior in the USD itself and gives you:

* **Modularity.** Attach, detach, or swap scripts on a prim without changing core logic.
* **Shareability.** Embed behaviors within assets and reuse them across projects or stages.
* **Configurability.** Expose variables as USD attributes and edit them without modifying source.
* **Persistence.** Scripts live on the prim and travel with the stage, so you can version them alongside it.
* **Reusability and encapsulation.** Write a behavior once and reuse it across prims and scenes with minimal external dependencies.

### Exposing variables through USD attributes

Each behavior script exposes its input parameters as namespaced USD attributes on the prim that carries the script. This lets you edit behavior parameters directly from the **Property** panel — or programmatically through the USD API — without modifying the script source.

Exposing variables as USD attributes provides three benefits:

* **Customization.** Tune parameters such as target locations, ranges, or seeds per prim instance.
* **Interactivity.** Edit values in the UI and observe the effect on the next update.
* **Consistency.** Every behavior presents the same editing interface regardless of its internal logic.

The scripts use the USD API to create custom attributes under a shared namespace (`exposedVar:<behaviorNamespace>:<attrName>`) and read them back during execution to drive their logic.

#### Core and UI extension split

The behavior functionality is split across two extensions:

* `isaacsim.replicator.behavior` — the **core** extension. It defines the behavior scripts, creates and removes the exposed USD attributes, and has no UI dependency. This lets you run the behaviors in headless mode (for example, during automated SDG pipelines).
* `isaacsim.replicator.behavior.ui` — the **UI** extension. It registers an `ExposedVariablesPropertyWidget` with the **Property** panel that automatically renders the exposed variables as editable fields.

The two extensions communicate through a single carb event, `isaacsim.replicator.behavior.EXPOSED_VARS_CHANGED`:

1. The core extension dispatches the event whenever it creates or removes exposed variables on a prim.
2. The UI extension subscribes to the event at startup and rebuilds the **Property** panel when it fires.

This event-based decoupling allows the core extension to run without the UI loaded, and the UI extension to refresh on demand without the core importing any UI modules.

**Example of Exposed Variables Definition:**

```python
VARIABLES_TO_EXPOSE = [
    {
        "attr_name": "targetLocation",
        "attr_type": Sdf.ValueTypeNames.Vector3d,
        "default_value": Gf.Vec3d(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
        "doc": "The 3D vector specifying the location to look at.",
    },
    {
        "attr_name": "targetPrimPath",
        "attr_type": Sdf.ValueTypeNames.String,
        "default_value": "",
        "doc": "The path of the target prim to look at. If specified, it has priority over the target location.",
    },
    # Additional variables...
]
```

### Custom event-based behavior scripts

Timeline-driven behaviors are convenient, but some workflows need to run independently of the simulation clock — for example, pre-simulation setup, one-shot scene preparation, or sequences that must complete before data capture begins.

**Event-based scripting** lets a behavior skip the default timeline hooks and instead publish and subscribe to [custom events](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/latest/guide/events.html) on the Omniverse event bus. This gives you:

* **Flexibility.** Trigger behaviors on demand, decoupled from the simulation timeline.
* **Modularity.** Orchestrate complex workflows by chaining behaviors through events.
* **Performance.** Avoid per-frame work by running behaviors only when triggered.

The `volume_stack_randomizer.py` script illustrates this pattern. It uses custom events to drop, stack, and settle assets using physics *before* the timeline starts, so the data-capture phase runs against a deterministic initial state.

## Script Examples

In this section, various behavior scripts available in the `isaacsim.replicator.behavior` extension are explored. Each script provides specific functionality that can enhance synthetic data generation workflows. The scripts are designed to be modular, reusable, and customizable through exposed variables.

The folder path for the behavior scripts is:

`/exts/isaacsim.replicator.behavior/isaacsim/replicator/behavior/behaviors/*`

### Location Randomizer

The `location_randomizer.py` script randomizes the location of prims within specified bounds during runtime, providing position variability for enhanced synthetic datasets.

Overview

**Purpose:** Randomizes prim positions within defined bounds to create variety in object placement.

**Key Features:**

* Position range randomization within minimum and maximum bounds
* Relative positioning support using target prims as reference points
* Child prim inclusion for hierarchical randomization
* Configurable update intervals for performance control

**Exposed Variables:**

Configuration Parameters

* **range:minPosition** (Vector3d): Minimum bounds of the random offset.
* **range:maxPosition** (Vector3d): Maximum bounds of the random offset.
* **frame:useRelativeFrame** (Bool): If True, preserve the prim’s initial offset (from the target prim if set, otherwise from its own starting position) and add the random offset on top. If False, the random offset is applied as an absolute position (relative to the target prim if set, otherwise to the world origin).
* **frame:targetPrimPath** (String): Optional path to a reference prim. When set, all randomization is anchored to this prim’s world location; leave empty to randomize independently of any other prim.
* **includeChildren** (Bool): Include child prims in randomization.
* **interval** (UInt): Update frequency (0 = every frame).

**Behavior Matrix:**

The combination of `frame:targetPrimPath` and `frame:useRelativeFrame` determines how the random offset is applied:

| `targetPrimPath` | `useRelativeFrame` | Resulting location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| empty | False | `random_offset` (treated as absolute world coordinates). |
| empty | True | `initial_location + random_offset` (jitter around the prim’s starting position). |
| set | False | `target_location + random_offset` (prim is placed near the target, ignoring its original position). |
| set | True | `target_location + initial_offset_from_target + random_offset` (prim follows the target while preserving its original relative offset). |

To make the prim’s randomization fully independent of any other prim, leave `frame:targetPrimPath` empty. Toggling `frame:useRelativeFrame` alone does not decouple the prim from the target.

Implementation Details

**Child Prim Inclusion:**

Child Prim Selection Logic

```python
def _setup(self):
    include_children = self._get_exposed_variable("includeChildren")
    if include_children:
        self._valid_prims = [prim for prim in Usd.PrimRange(self.prim) if prim.IsA(UsdGeom.Xformable)]
    elif self.prim.IsA(UsdGeom.Xformable):
        self._valid_prims = [self.prim]
    else:
        self._valid_prims = []
        carb.log_warn(f"[{self.prim_path}] No valid prims found.")
```

* When **includeChildren** is True: Uses Usd.PrimRange to select all transformable descendant prims
* When **includeChildren** is False: Only includes the assigned prim if it’s transformable
* Logs warning if no valid prims are found

**Randomization Logic:**

Core Randomization Implementation

```python
def _randomize_location(self, prim):
    # Generate random offset within bounds
    random_offset = Gf.Vec3d(
        random.uniform(self._min_position[0], self._max_position[0]),
        random.uniform(self._min_position[1], self._max_position[1]),
        random.uniform(self._min_position[2], self._max_position[2]),
    )

    # Calculate final location based on target prim and relative frame settings
    if self._target_prim:
        target_loc = get_world_location(self._target_prim)
        loc = (
            target_loc + self._target_offsets[prim] + random_offset
            if self._use_relative_frame
            else target_loc + random_offset
        )
    else:
        loc = self._initial_locations[prim] + random_offset if self._use_relative_frame else random_offset

    self._set_location(prim, loc)
```

* Generates a random offset within the configured `range:minPosition` / `range:maxPosition` bounds.
* If `frame:targetPrimPath` is set, anchors the result to the target prim’s current world location.
* If `frame:useRelativeFrame` is True, preserves the prim’s initial offset (from the target prim if set, otherwise from its own starting position) so the random offset acts as jitter rather than an absolute placement.
* Writes the final location to the prim using the existing translate or transform xformOp.

Usage Example

**Basic Setup:**

Step-by-Step Configuration

1. **Attach Script**: Add location\_randomizer.py to your target prim
2. **Set Bounds**: Configure range:minPosition and range:maxPosition
3. **Enable Children**: Set includeChildren to True for hierarchical randomization
4. **Set Interval**: Use interval to control update frequency

**Example Configuration:**

* **range:minPosition**: (-5.0, -5.0, 0.0)
* **range:maxPosition**: (5.0, 5.0, 2.0)
* **includeChildren**: True
* **interval**: 5 (updates every 5 frames)

**Use Cases:**

* **Background Objects**: Randomize prop positions for scene variety. Leave `frame:targetPrimPath` empty and set `frame:useRelativeFrame` to True to jitter each prop around its authored location.
* **Follow a Moving Target**: Keep an object’s relative offset to a moving prim. Set `frame:targetPrimPath` to the target and `frame:useRelativeFrame` to True.
* **Snap Near a Target**: Place an object at randomized positions around a target, ignoring its original location. Set `frame:targetPrimPath` to the target and `frame:useRelativeFrame` to False.
* **Hierarchical Randomization**: Apply randomization to object groups by enabling `includeChildren`.

### Rotation Randomizer

    elif self.prim.IsA(UsdGeom.Xformable):
        self._valid_prims = [self.prim]
    else:
        self._valid_prims = []
        carb.log_warn(f"[{self.prim_path}] No valid prims found.")
```

* When **includeChildren** is True: All transformable descendant prims are included
* When **includeChildren** is False: Only the assigned prim is considered if transformable
* Warning logged if no valid prims found

**Rotation Randomization:**

Core Rotation Implementation

```python
def _randomize_rotation(self, prim):
    rotation = (
        Gf.Rotation(Gf.Vec3d.XAxis(), random.uniform(self._min_rotation[0], self._max_rotation[0]))
        * Gf.Rotation(Gf.Vec3d.YAxis(), random.uniform(self._min_rotation[1], self._max_rotation[1]))
        * Gf.Rotation(Gf.Vec3d.ZAxis(), random.uniform(self._min_rotation[2], self._max_rotation[2]))
    )
    set_rotation_with_ops(prim, rotation)
```

* Generates random Euler angles within specified bounds for each axis

* **interval**: 10 (updates every 10 frames)

**Use Cases:**

* **Object Variety**: Randomize prop orientations for diverse scenes
* **Tumbling Effects**: Simulate falling or floating objects
* **Presentation Angles**: Vary object viewing angles for training data

### Look At Behavior

The `look_at_behavior.py` script orients prims to continuously face a specified target, ideal for camera tracking and sensor alignment.

Overview

**Purpose:** Orients prims to continuously face a target location or another prim.

* **interval** (UInt): Update frequency (0 = every frame)

Implementation Details

**Target Prim Handling:**

Target Prim Resolution

```python
def _setup(self):
    target_prim_path = self._get_exposed_variable("targetPrimPath")
    if target_prim_path:
        self._target_prim = self.stage.GetPrimAtPath(target_prim_path)
        if not self._target_prim or not self._target_prim.IsValid() or not self._target_prim.IsA(UsdGeom.Xformable):
            self._target_prim = None
            carb.log_warn(f"[{self.prim_path}] Invalid target prim path: {target_prim_path}")
```

* **targetPrimPath** takes precedence over **targetLocation** when specified
* Validates target prim exists and is transformable
* Logs warning if target prim is invalid

```python
def _apply_behavior(self):
    target_location = self._get_target_location()
    for prim in self._valid_prims:
        eye = get_world_location(prim)
        if (target_location - eye).GetLength() < 1e-9:
            continue  # Already at target; skip rotation to avoid undefined look-at
        look_at_rotation = calculate_look_at_rotation(eye, target_location, self._up_axis)
        set_rotation_with_ops(prim, look_at_rotation)

Implementation Details

**Core Structure:**

Class Architecture

```python
class VolumeStackRandomizer(BehaviorScript):
    BEHAVIOR_NS = "volumeStackRandomizer"
    EVENT_NAME_IN = f"{EXTENSION_NAME}.{BEHAVIOR_NS}.in"
    EVENT_NAME_OUT = f"{EXTENSION_NAME}.{BEHAVIOR_NS}.out"
    ACTION_FUNCTION_MAP = {
        "setup": "_setup_async",
        "run": "_run_behavior_async",
        "reset": "_reset_async",
    }

    async def _setup_async(self):
        # Asynchronous setup logic...
        pass

    async def _run_behavior_async(self):
        # Asynchronous behavior execution...
        pass

    async def _reset_async(self):
        # Asynchronous reset logic...
        pass
```

* Event-based behavior using custom events for lifecycle management
* Asynchronous methods for non-blocking physics simulation
* Action function mapping for external event control

**Child Prim Selection:**

Surface Area Discovery

```python
async def _setup_async(self):
    include_children = self._get_exposed_variable("includeChildren")
    if include_children:
        self._valid_prims = [prim for prim in Usd.PrimRange(self.prim) if prim.IsA(UsdGeom.Gprim)]
    elif self.prim.IsA(UsdGeom.Gprim):
        self._valid_prims = [self.prim]
    else:
        self._valid_prims = []
        carb.log_warn(f"[{self.prim_path}] No valid prims found.")
```

* Identifies geometric prims suitable for object stacking surfaces
* Includes child prims when **includeChildren** is enabled
* Validates surface prims can receive physics objects

Event-Based Control

**Custom Event System:**

Event-Based Execution Control

The Volume Stack Randomizer operates using custom events rather than timeline-based updates, allowing for precise control over when stacking operations occur.

**Event Flow:**

1. **Reset Phase**: Cleans up previous simulation state
2. **Setup Phase**: Spawns assets and prepares physics simulation
3. **Run Phase**: Executes physics simulation for object stacking
4. **Completion**: Publishes completion event with final state

**Event Control Example:**

```python
async def run_stacking_simulation_async(prim_path=None):
    actions = [("reset", "RESET", 10), ("setup", "SETUP", 500), ("run", "FINISHED", 1500)]
    for action, state, wait in actions:
        await publish_event_and_wait_for_completion_async(
            publish_payload={"prim_path": prim_path, "action": action},
            expected_payload={"prim_path": prim_path, "state_name": state},
            publish_event_name=VolumeStackRandomizer.EVENT_NAME_IN,
            subscribe_event_name=VolumeStackRandomizer.EVENT_NAME_OUT,
            max_wait_updates=wait,
        )
```

**Integration Benefits:**

* **Precise Control**: Execute stacking at specific workflow points
* **Sequential Operations**: Chain multiple stacking operations
* **State Management**: Track completion of each simulation phase
* **External Orchestration**: Control from external scripts or systems

Usage Example

**Basic Setup:**

Step-by-Step Configuration

1. **Attach Script**: Add volume\_stack\_randomizer.py to surface prims
2. **Configure Assets**: Set assets:csv or assets:assets with object paths
3. **Set Parameters**: Define assets:numRange, dropHeight, and other settings
4. **Control Events**: Use custom events to trigger stacking operations

**Example Configuration:**

* **assets:csv**: “box1.usd,box2.usd,cylinder.usd”
* **assets:numRange**: (5, 20) (spawn 5-20 objects)
* **dropHeight**: 2.0 (drop from 2 units above surface)
* **renderSimulation**: True (show simulation steps)
* **preserveSimulationState**: True (keep final arrangement)

**Use Cases:**

* **Object Arrangement**: Create realistic piles of objects
* **Physics Validation**: Test object interactions and stability
* **Scene Preparation**: Set up complex scenes before data capture
* **Simulation Workflows**: Integrate physics-based randomization into pipelines

### Templates

This section provides template scripts that serve as starting points for creating custom behaviors.

Available Templates

**Template Scripts:**

* **example\_behavior.py**: Basic template with boilerplate code for new behaviors
* **base\_behavior.py** and **example\_base\_behavior.py**: Demonstrate base behavior class inheritance for structured development
* **example\_custom\_event\_behavior.py**: Shows implementation of event-based behaviors

**Key Template Features:**

* **Variable Exposure**: Demonstrates exposing variables as USD attributes for UI customization
* **Behavior Structure**: Provides necessary methods (on\_init, on\_play, on\_update, on\_stop, on\_destroy) for timeline integration
* **Extensibility**: Base behavior classes enable easy extension and reuse in new behaviors
* **Event Integration**: Shows both timeline-based and custom event-based approaches

## Example

Below is an example demonstrating the use of behavior scripts to set up and run synthetic data generation in Isaac Sim. It showcases how to utilize behavior scripts for stacking simulations, texture randomization, light behavior, and camera tracking, ultimately capturing synthetic data with randomized scene configurations.

**Key Highlights of the Example:**

* **Volume Stacking Simulation**: Randomly stack assets using physics simulation to create realistic arrangements.
* **Texture Randomization**: Apply randomized textures to assets for scene diversity.
* **Light and Camera Behaviors**: Add randomization to light properties and make the camera track a specific target.
* **Synthetic Data Capture**: Generate and save synthetic images with the configured behaviors.
