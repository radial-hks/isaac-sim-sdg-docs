# Synthetic Data Recorder

This tutorial introduces the Synthetic Data Recorder for Isaac Sim, which is a GUI extension for recording synthetic data with the possibility of using [custom writers](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/custom_writer.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") to record the data in various formats.

The Synthetic Data Recorder requires assets to be [semantically labelled](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/semantics_schema_editor.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") for all of the annotators to work correctly. The recorder uses the `BasicWriter` by default with access to most common [annotators](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/annotators_details.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)").

## Getting Started

The UI window can be opened from the main menu using **Tools** > **Replicator** > **Synthetic Data Recorder**.

This tutorial uses the following stage as an example:

```python
https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/6.0
/Isaac/Samples/Replicator/Stage/full_warehouse_worker_and_anim_cameras.usd
```

The stage asset can be found in the **Content Browser** under **Isaac Sim** > **Samples** > **Replicator** > **Stage** > **full\_warehouse\_worker\_and\_anim\_cameras.usd**, or can be loaded using by inserting the whole URL in the path field.

The example stage comes preloaded with semantic annotations and multiple cameras. Some of the included cameras are animated to move around the scene when running the simulation. To create custom camera movement animations, review the [Camera Animation Tutorial](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_animation-timeline.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)").

## Basic Usage

The recorder is split into two main parts:

* the **Writer** frame - containing sensor, data, and output parameters
* the **Control** frame - containing the recording functionalities such as start, stop, pause, and parameters such as the number of frames to execute

### Writer Frame

The **Writer** frame provides access to **Render Products**, **Parameters**, **Output**, and **Config** options.

The **Render Products** frame allows the creation of a list of render product entries using the **Add New Render Product** button. By default, a new entry is added to the list using the active viewport camera as its camera path (see left figure). If cameras are selected in the stage viewer, these are added to the render products list (see right figure). The render products list can include the same camera path multiple times, with each instance having a different resolution. All entry values, such as camera path or resolution, can be manually edited in the input fields.

The **Parameters** frame offers a choice between the default built-in Replicator writer (`BasicWriter`) and a custom writer. Default writer parameters, primarily annotators, can be selected from the checkbox list. Parameters for custom writers, which are unknown beforehand, must be provided in the form of a JSON file containing all required parameters. The path to the JSON file is entered in the **Parameters Path** input field.

The **Output** frame (left figure) specifies the working directory path where the data is saved, along with the folder name for the current recording. The output folder name is incremented in case of conflicts. The recorder also supports writing to S3 buckets by enabling **Use S3**, entering the required fields, and ensuring AWS credentials are properly configured.

Note

When writing to S3, the **Increment** folder naming feature is not supported and defaults to **Timestamp**.

The **Config** frame (right figure) allows loading and saving the GUI writer state as a JSON configuration file. By default, the extension loads the most recently used configuration state.

### Control Frame

The **Control** frame contains the recording functionalities such as Start/Stop and Pause/Resume, and parameters such as the number of frames to record or the number of subframes to render for each recorded frame.

* The **Start** button creates a writer, given the selected parameters, and starts the recording.
* The **Stop** button stops the recording and clears the writer.
* The **Pause** button pauses the recording without clearing the writer.
* The **Resume** button resumes the recording.
* The **Number of Frames** input field sets the number of frames to record, after which the recorder is stopped and the writer cleared. If the value is set to `0`, the recording runs indefinitely or until the **Stop** button is pressed.
* The **RTSubframes** field sets the number of additional subframes to render for each per frame. This can be used if randomized materials are not loaded in time or if temporal rendering artifacts (such as ghosting) are present due to objects being teleported.
* The **Control Timeline** checkbox starts, stops, pauses, and resumes the timeline together with the recorder.
* The **Verbose** checkbox enables verbose logging for the recorder (events such as start, stop, pause, resume, and the number of frames recorded).

Note

To improve the rendering quality, or to avoid any rendering artifacts caused by low lighting conditions or fast-moving objects, increase the **RTSubframes** parameter. This renders multiple subframes for each frame, thereby improving the quality of recorded data at the expense of longer rendering times per frame. For more details, see the [subframes](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/subframes_examples.html#subframes-examples "(in Omniverse Extensions)") documentation.

## Custom Writer Example

To support custom data formats, the custom writer can be registered and loaded from the GUI. In this example, a custom writer called `MyCustomWriter` is registered using the [Script Editor](../development_tools/omniverse_script_editor.html#script-editor) for use with the recorder.

The Synthetic Data Recorder initializes the selected disk or cloud backend, then calls `writer.initialize(backend=..., **parameters)`. Starting in recent Isaac Sim / Replicator releases, those keyword arguments are applied when the writer is constructed. Custom writers must therefore accept a `backend` argument (the configured `DiskBackend` or `S3Backend` instance) or accept arbitrary keyword arguments with `**kwargs`. They should write using that backend rather than constructing a separate `BackendDispatch` from a raw output path when `backend` is supplied.

MyCustomWriter

```python
import numpy as np
import omni.replicator.core as rep
from omni.replicator.core import AnnotatorRegistry, BackendDispatch, Writer
from omni.replicator.core import functional as F
from omni.replicator.core.scripts.backends import BaseBackend

    """Minimal disk writer for rgb / normals (compatible with ``DiskBackend`` from the Synthetic Data Recorder)."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        rgb: bool = True,
        normals: bool = False,
        output_dir: str | None = None,
        backend: BaseBackend | None = None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        self.version = "0.0.1"
        self.data_structure = "renderProduct"

        if backend is not None and not isinstance(backend, BaseBackend):
            raise TypeError("`backend` must inherit from `omni.replicator.core.scripts.backends.BaseBackend`.")

        if backend is not None:
            self.backend = backend
        elif output_dir:
            self.backend = BackendDispatch(output_dir=output_dir)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Provide `backend` (for example from the recorder) or `output_dir`.")

                    n_arr = n_entry["data"] if isinstance(n_entry, dict) and "data" in n_entry else n_entry
                    colored = ((n_arr * 0.5 + 0.5) * 255).astype(np.uint8)
                    self.backend.schedule(
                        F.write_image, path=f"{rp_prefix}normals/normals_{self._frame_id}.png", data=colored
                    )
            self._frame_id += 1
            return

        for annotator in list(data.keys()):
            annotator_split = annotator.split("-")
            render_product_path = ""
            multi_render_prod = 0
            if len(annotator_split) > 1:

        self._frame_id = 0

rep.writers.register_writer(MyCustomWriter)
```

my\_params.json

```python
1{
2    "rgb": true,
3    "normals": true
4}
```

### Data Visualization Writer

The **Data Visualization** writer is a custom writer that can be used to visualize the annotation data on top of rendered images. The writer and its implementation details can be found in `/isaacsim.replicator.writers/python/scripts/writers/data_visualization_writer.py`, and can be imported using `from isaacsim.replicator.writers import DataVisualizationWriter`. The custom writer can be selected from the **Parameters** frame and its parameters can be loaded from a JSON file using the **Parameters Path** input field. Here is an example JSON file that can be used to parameterize the writer:

my\_data\_visualization\_params.json

```python
 1{
 2    "bounding_box_2d_tight": true,
 3    "bounding_box_2d_tight_params": {
 4        "background": "rgb",
 5        "outline": "green",
 6        "fill": null
 7    },
 8    "bounding_box_2d_loose": true,
 9    "bounding_box_2d_loose_params": {
10        "background": "normals",
11        "outline": "red",
12        "fill": null
13    },
14    "bounding_box_3d": true,
15    "bounding_box_3d_params": {
16        "background": "rgb",
17        "fill": "blue",
18        "width": 2
19    }
20}
```

And the resulting data:

```

## Replicator Randomized Cameras

To take advantage of Replicator randomization techniques, randomized cameras can be loaded using the [Script Editor](../development_tools/omniverse_script_editor.html#script-editor) before starting the recorder to run scene randomizations during recording. In this example a randomized camera is created using the Replicator API. This can be attached as a render product to the recorder and for each frame the camera is randomized with the given parameters.

```python
import omni.replicator.core as rep

camera = rep.create.camera()
with rep.trigger.on_frame():
    with camera:
        rep.modify.pose(
            position=rep.distribution.uniform((-5, 5, 1), (-1, 15, 5)),
            look_at="/Root/Warehouse/SM_CardBoxA_3",
        )
```

## Recording Loop Overview

The **Synthetic Data Recorder** is a GUI extension for Isaac Sim that uses the `BasicWriter` or custom Replicator writers for capturing data. Its implementation is located in `/isaacsim.replicator.synthetic_recorder/isaacsim/replicator/synthetic_recorder/synthetic_recorder.py` and utilizes the `orchestrator.step(rt_subframes, pause_timeline, delta_time)` function to manage the recording process. This function ensures that recorded frames remain synchronized with the stage by waiting for any “frames in flight” from the renderer. For integration with the UI, the recorder uses the asynchronous version of this function: `step_async`.

```python
while self._current_frame < num_frames:
    timeline = omni.timeline.get_timeline_interface()

    if self.control_timeline and not timeline.is_playing():
        timeline.play()
        timeline.commit()

    await rep.orchestrator.step_async(rt_subframes=self.rt_subframes, delta_time=None, pause_timeline=False)

    self._current_frame += 1
```

The recording loop offers flexibility for different use cases. It can advance the timeline for dynamic scenes, such as simulations or animations, or operate without advancing the timeline for static captures. This approach enables recording scenarios like randomizing views, adjusting lighting conditions, or repositioning objects.
