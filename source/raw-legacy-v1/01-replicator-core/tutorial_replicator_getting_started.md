# Getting Started Scripts

This guide outlines a series of example scripts designed to facilitate typical Isaac Sim Replicator workflows. The examples include both “asynchronous” usage through the [Script Editor](../development_tools/omniverse_script_editor.html#script-editor) and “synchronous” usage through the [Standalone Application](../introduction/workflows.html#standalone-application). These scripts cover simulation-based scenarios and configurations for synthetic data generation (SDG).

## Prerequisites

Before starting with these examples, ensure you have:

* Basic understanding of Python programming
* Familiarity with USD (Universal Scene Description) concepts
* Access to NVIDIA Omniverse™ Isaac Sim
* Sufficient disk space for data capture (varies based on resolution and number of frames)
* GPU with sufficient memory for rendering (recommended: 8GB+)

## Setup and Configuration

This section introduces configurations typically used in such workflows.

## Orchestrator Step Function

In Replicator, the `orchestrator.step()` function is used to trigger the entire synthetic data generation (SDG) process, including executing randomizations and capturing data. For Isaac Sim workflows, this function is used solely to trigger data capture only, with randomization triggers assigned to custom events and manually activated.

The `step()` function has the following signature:

```python
rep.orchestrator.step(rt_subframes: int = -1, pause_timeline: bool = True, delta_time: float = None, wait_for_render: bool = True)
```

Where:

* `rt_subframes`: Specifies the number of subframes to render. A value greater than 0 enables subframe generation, reducing rendering artifacts or allowing materials to load fully.
* `pause_timeline`: Pauses the timeline (if currently playing) after the step if set to `True`.
* `delta_time`: Specifies the time to advance the timeline during a step. Defaults to the timeline’s rate if `None`.
* `wait_for_render`: If `True`, the function blocks until the renderer completes the current frame before returning. Defaults to `True`.

More details on graph-based replicator randomizers can be found in the [Randomizer Details](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/randomizer_details.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)"), and for custom Isaac Sim or USD API-based randomizations, refer to the [Isaac Sim Randomizers Guide](tutorial_replicator_isaac_randomizers.html#isaac-sim-app-tutorial-replicator-isaac-randomizers).

## Capture on Play Flag

By default, Replicator captures data every frame during playback. For Isaac Sim workflows, data capture is configured to occur at user-defined frames using the `step()` function. To achieve this, the capture-on-play flag is disabled:

```python
import omni.replicator.core as rep

rep.orchestrator.set_capture_on_play(False)
# OR
import carb.settings

carb.settings.get_settings().set("/omni/replicator/captureOnPlay", False)
```

## RT Subframes Parameter

In scenarios where reducing temporal rendering artifacts is needed, such as ghosting caused by quickly moving or teleporting assets, or under weak lighting conditions, RTSubframes can be used to render the same frame multiple times. This pauses the simulation and renders additional subframes, improving rendering quality.

The `rt_subframes` parameter is typically set during the capture request in the `step()` function but can also be configured globally:

```python
# Set the rt_subframes parameter for a specific capture step
rep.orchestrator.step(rt_subframes=4)

# Set the rt_subframes parameter globally
import carb.settings

carb.settings.get_settings().set("/omni/replicator/RTSubframes", 4)
```

Refer to the [documentation examples](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/subframes_examples.html#subframes-examples "(in Omniverse Extensions)") for additional details.

## DLSS Quality Mode for SDG

When using Replicator for synthetic data generation (SDG) workflows, it is recommended to set the DLSS model to Quality mode to avoid rendering artifacts. At lower resolutions (especially below 600x600), the default Performance mode may cause issues such as transparent or incorrectly rendered edges in the generated images.

```python
import carb.settings

# Set DLSS to Quality mode (2) for best SDG results (Options: 0 (Performance), 1 (Balanced), 2 (Quality), 3 (Auto))
carb.settings.get_settings().set("/rtx/post/dlss/execMode", 2)
```

## Wait for Render Parameter

By default, the `step()` function blocks until the renderer finishes producing the current frame before returning. Setting `wait_for_render=False` decouples the capture request from the rendering pipeline, allowing the next randomization to begin immediately while the previous frame is still being rendered. This can significantly improve throughput in workflows where the captured data does not need to exactly match the current simulation state at the time the `step()` call returns.

```python
# Default behavior: blocks until the frame is rendered
rep.orchestrator.step(wait_for_render=True)

# Non-blocking: returns immediately, allowing the next randomization to start
rep.orchestrator.step(wait_for_render=False)
```

Note

When using `wait_for_render=False`, the annotation and writer data may correspond to a previous frame rather than the frame triggered by the most recent `step()` call. Use this mode only when strict frame-to-data correspondence is not required.

## Write to Fabric Mode

Fabric is the runtime data layer that the renderer reads from directly. By default, Replicator writes attribute changes (such as positions, rotations, and colors) to the USD stage, which are then synchronized to Fabric before rendering. Enabling write-to-fabric mode bypasses the USD stage and writes changes directly to Fabric, reducing the overhead of USD-to-Fabric synchronization and improving randomization performance.

```python
import carb.settings

# Enable write-to-fabric mode
carb.settings.get_settings().set("/exts/omni.replicator.core/enableWriteToFabric", True)
```

Note

Because changes are written directly to Fabric and bypass the USD stage, they will not be reflected in the USD stage or persisted when saving the scene. This mode is intended for transient randomizations during data generation, not for permanent scene modifications.

## Custom Event Randomizations

To provide flexibility, replicator randomizers can be triggered independently using custom events. This is achieved by registering the randomizer trigger through `trigger.on_custom_event` and activating it with `utils.send_og_event`. For instance, the following example creates a randomization graph for a dome light and randomizes its color. The randomization graph is then triggered manually through its custom event name. The `step()` function does not trigger this randomization graph.

```python
# Create a randomization graph for creating a dome light and randomizing its color
with rep.trigger.on_custom_event(event_name="randomize_dome_light_color"):
    rep.create.light(light_type="Dome", color=rep.distribution.uniform((0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)))

# Trigger the randomization graph using its custom event name
rep.utils.send_og_event(event_name="randomize_dome_light_color")
```

An example snippet for custom events is also available [here](tutorial_replicator_isaac_snippets.html#replicator-isaac-snippets-custom-event).

## Wait Until Complete

Ensuring that all data is fully written to disk before closing the application is essential to prevent data loss. High data throughput, such as from multiple cameras or large resolutions, may introduce I/O bottlenecks; refer to the [I/O Optimization Guide](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_replicator/io_guidelines.html "(in Omniverse Extensions)") for strategies to mitigate such issues.

The `wait_until_complete` function ensures that all writing tasks are finalized by waiting for the writer backend to complete its operations. This process allows the application to continue updating until all writing tasks are complete, safeguarding against potential data loss.

```python
from omni.replicator.core import BackendDispatch
import omni.kit.app

async def wait_until_complete():
    while not BackendDispatch.is_done_writing():
        await omni.kit.app.get_app().next_update_async()
```

Alternatively, use the documented helper functions: `rep.orchestrator.wait_until_complete()` for synchronous contexts or `await rep.orchestrator.wait_until_complete_async()` for asynchronous contexts.

## Examples

### Data Capture: BasicWriter

This example demonstrates how to use the `BasicWriter` for data capture with RGB and bounding box annotators. It sets up a scene with a cube and a dome light, attaches semantic labels to the cube, and saves captured data to disk. The standalone example can also be run directly (on Windows use `python.bat` instead of `python.sh`):

```python
./python.sh standalone_examples/api/isaacsim.replicator.examples/sdg_getting_started_01.py
```

Script Editor

```python
import asyncio
import os

import carb.settings
import omni.replicator.core as rep
import omni.usd

async def run_example_async():
    # Create a new stage and disable capture on play
    omni.usd.get_context().new_stage()
    rep.orchestrator.set_capture_on_play(False)

    # Set DLSS to Quality mode (2) for best SDG results (Options: 0 (Performance), 1 (Balanced), 2 (Quality), 3 (Auto)
    carb.settings.get_settings().set("rtx/post/dlss/execMode", 2)

    # Setup the stage with a dome light and a cube
    rep.functional.create.xform(name="World")
    rep.functional.create.dome_light(intensity=500, parent="/World", name="DomeLight")
    cube = rep.functional.create.cube(parent="/World", name="Cube")
    rep.functional.modify.semantics(cube, {"class": "my_cube"}, mode="add")

    # Create a render product using the viewport perspective camera
    cam = rep.functional.create.camera(position=(5, 5, 5), look_at=(0, 0, 0), parent="/World", name="Camera")
    rp = rep.create.render_product(cam, (512, 512), name="MyRenderProduct")

    # Write data using the basic writer with the rgb and bounding box annotators
    backend = rep.backends.get("DiskBackend")
    out_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "_out_basic_writer")
    backend.initialize(output_dir=out_dir)
    print(f"Output directory: {out_dir}")
    writer = rep.writers.get("BasicWriter")
    writer.initialize(backend=backend, rgb=True, bounding_box_2d_tight=True)
    writer.attach(rp)

    # Trigger a data capture request (data will be written to disk by the writer)
    for i in range(3):
        print(f"Step {i}")
        await rep.orchestrator.step_async()

    # Wait for the data to be written to disk and clean up resources
    await rep.orchestrator.wait_until_complete_async()
    writer.detach()
    rp.destroy()

# Run the example
asyncio.ensure_future(run_example_async())
```

Standalone Application

```python
"""Demonstrate basic synthetic data generation with a writer and render product."""

import os

from isaacsim import SimulationApp

simulation_app = SimulationApp(launch_config={"headless": False})

import carb.settings
import omni.replicator.core as rep
import omni.usd

def run_example():
    """Run a basic SDG pipeline capturing RGB and bounding box data."""
    # Create a new stage and disable capture on play
    omni.usd.get_context().new_stage()
    rep.orchestrator.set_capture_on_play(False)

    # Set DLSS to Quality mode (2) for best SDG results , options: 0 (Performance), 1 (Balanced), 2 (Quality), 3 (Auto)

    cube = rep.functional.create.cube(parent="/World", name="Cube")
    rep.functional.modify.semantics(cube, {"class": "my_cube"}, mode="add")

    # Create a render product using the viewport perspective camera
    cam = rep.functional.create.camera(position=(5, 5, 5), look_at=(0, 0, 0), parent="/World", name="Camera")
    rp = rep.create.render_product(cam, (512, 512), name="MyRenderProduct")

    # Write data using the basic writer with the rgb and bounding box annotators
    backend = rep.backends.get("DiskBackend")
    out_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "_out_basic_writer")
    backend.initialize(output_dir=out_dir)
    print(f"Output directory: {out_dir}")
    writer = rep.writers.get("BasicWriter")
    writer.initialize(backend=backend, rgb=True, bounding_box_2d_tight=True)
    writer.attach(rp)

    # Trigger a data capture request (data will be written to disk by the writer)
    for i in range(3):
        print(f"Step {i}")
        rep.orchestrator.step()

    # Wait for the data to be written to disk and clean up resources
    rep.orchestrator.wait_until_complete()
    writer.detach()
    rp.destroy()

run_example()
```

The output directory will contain the captured data, including RGB images and bounding box annotations in `.npy` and `.json` formats:

### Custom Writer and Annotators with Multiple Cameras

This example demonstrates data capture by creating a custom writer to access annotator data such as camera parameters and 3D bounding boxes. It configures two cameras (custom and viewport perspective), uses annotators to access data directly, writes data to disk using `PoseWriter`. The standalone example can also be run directly (on Windows use `python.bat` instead of `python.sh`):

```python
./python.sh standalone_examples/api/isaacsim.replicator.examples/sdg_getting_started_02.py

### Custom Randomizations: Replicator Graph and USD API

This example demonstrates creating a custom randomization using Replicator’s graph-based randomizers triggered by custom events and a custom USD API-based randomization. A dome light’s color is randomized through custom events, while a cube’s location is randomized through USD API. Data is captured using the `BasicWriter` with semantic segmentation. The standalone example can also be run directly (on Windows use `python.bat` instead of `python.sh`):

```python
./python.sh standalone_examples/api/isaacsim.replicator.examples/sdg_getting_started_03.py

### Event-Triggered Data Capture: Timeline and Simulation

This example shows how to capture simulation data when specific conditions are met. A cube and sphere are dropped in a physics simulation, and data is captured at specific intervals based on the cube’s height. The timeline is paused during capture to ensure data consistency. The standalone example can also be run directly (on Windows use `python.bat` instead of `python.sh`):

```python
./python.sh standalone_examples/api/isaacsim.replicator.examples/sdg_getting_started_04.py
```

The output directory will contain the RGB and semantic segmentation images with the captured data at specific simulation times (cube drop height intervals) and the cube hidden during capture. During every second capture with the cube hidden, the timeline will not advance (`delta_time=0.0`) ensuring the same simulation state can be captured multiple times.

### Batch Randomization with Performance Optimization

This example demonstrates batch creation and randomization of 100 cubes using the functional API and `ReplicatorRNG`. It runs three configurations to compare performance: default (`wait_for_render=True`), non-blocking capture (`wait_for_render=False`), and non-blocking capture with [write-to-fabric](#isaac-sim-replicator-getting-started-write-to-fabric) enabled. Each run prints per-step randomization and capture timings as well as the total duration including `wait_until_complete`, illustrating the impact of [wait\_for\_render](#isaac-sim-replicator-getting-started-wait-for-render) and [write-to-fabric](#isaac-sim-replicator-getting-started-write-to-fabric) on throughput. The standalone example can also be run directly (on Windows use `python.bat` instead of `python.sh`):

```python
./python.sh standalone_examples/api/isaacsim.replicator.examples/sdg_getting_started_05.py
